### Hi there 👋

My name is Felix, I've recently graduated from the University of Oxford with a degree in Engineering Science.

This github contains some projects I've worked on, but for a complete look at my faovourite projects check out [my website](https://felixomahony.github.io).

I'm planning to add more to this document in the coming few weeks 🏗.
